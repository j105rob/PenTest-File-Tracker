PenTest-File-Tracker
====================

Based on a idea from a Kos tweet, I thought it would be a nice to have in the toolkit. This little app is browser based and uses local storage to track changes in files by MD5 the contents ( read from the local file as a binary string). It creates a JSON for local storage that is persisted across sessions. 

The Key to the storage object is the file's name, the object that is stored looks like {fileName:"somefile",history:[{time:"",hash:"",data:""},...]}. Time is defined as Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000).

If the file's hash is different, then a new historty item is pushed onto the history array.
