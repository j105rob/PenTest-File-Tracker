PenTest-File-Tracker
====================

Based on a idea from a Kos tweet, I thought it would be a nice to have in the toolkit. This little app is browser based and uses local storage to track changes in files by MD5 the contents ( read from the local file as a binary string). It creates a JSON for local storage that is persisted across sessions. 

The Key to the storage object is the file's name, the object that is stored looks like:

'''javascript
{fileName:"somefile",history:[{time:"",hash:"",data:""},...]}. 
'''
Time is defined as:

'''javascript
Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000).
'''

If the file's hash is different, then a new history item is pushed onto the history array.

To clear out the local storage, just hit the "Clear Storage" button.
